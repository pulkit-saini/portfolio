📁 Portfolio Website
This is a personal portfolio website project built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Media Queries. I created this project purely for fun and practice, to strengthen my front-end skills and get hands-on experience with responsive design.

The website layout is fully responsive and adjusts smoothly across various screen sizes — from mobile phones to desktops. I used Bootstrap's grid system and components for structure and styling, along with custom CSS and media queries to fine-tune responsiveness and visual appeal.
